## Data Collection Methodology
- Mainly we used to get global and Local Data [Our World In Data (owid)](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) set to filter out sub data sets. We have used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas to clean and filter our raw data.And also, we got some data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).  There are some irregularities, because of some data is not publishing a proper format.
- Then we move on to Local data, we had to use [Govermant daily reports](https://www.epid.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=225&Itemid=518&lang=en) which was on pdf to examine and filter out data such as District Distribution, total recovered cases, Vaccination Process,...etc. We had to collect Tourism Data from [Government Torism Research and Statistic Site](https://www.sltda.gov.lk/en/statistics) to get Tourist Arrival details.
- When we dig more about Vaccines and virus varients we had to get data from [WHO Covid-19 page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) 


## Main Purpose
- We had to conduct a research About Covid-19 and visualize those data using dashboard as an Assignment. 
- Then we wanted to find how Covid virus impact to Sri Lanka. How it impacts to Tourism Sector, Education sector. How Vaccination Process On going. Is there an any decrease reporting total Infection Cases using Forecasting. how Clusters Going on and how many infections reported from clusters... etc.

#### Special note : some times, the person who responsible and hanlde data, distorts data reporting format to include or exclude a certain category of infection Cases or deaths, because of that there are significant data mutations in this data set. I just used these data only for my purpose.
